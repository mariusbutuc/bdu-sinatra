I had all this material for reading, but as other times when I had to self educate myself, I didn't know where to start... and I often found myself starting with more books at a time and never got to finish them. This is why I was saying that is very well structured. First watch the videos for an overview, then read chapter X from book A, and chapter x, y, z from book B. Then summarize with exercises. So far, I can't criticize anything... Didn't find anything I disliked about the course...Thank you for a new learning experience!" },
